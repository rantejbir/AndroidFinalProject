# AndroidFinalProject
•	In this project, I developed an Android application that integrates with an API using the Volley library
•	Implements login and signup functionality and performs CRUD operations using a local database. 
•	The main objective of the project was to create a robust and user-friendly app that interacts with a remote API
•	Securely stores user data and provides seamless data management capabilities.
